## Linear Regression

Description: Linear regression is a simple yet powerful algorithm used for predictive analysis. It models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

Implementation:
- Python: [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html)

## Decision Trees

Description: Decision trees are non-parametric supervised learning models used for both classification and regression tasks. They learn simple decision rules inferred from the data features.

Implementation:
- Python: [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html)

## Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Description: Support Vector Machines are supervised learning models used for classification and regression analysis. They find the hyperplane that best separates classes in a high-dimensional space.

Implementation:
- Python: [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html)

## Neural Networks

Description: Neural Networks are a class of models inspired by the biological structure of the brain. They consist of interconnected layers of nodes, each performing a simple computation, allowing them to learn complex patterns from data.

Implementation:
- Python: [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
